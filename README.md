### Calculator Application Using Method Overloading

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This project is a simple Calculator Application built in Java to demonstrate the concept of method overloading.
It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division through a menu-driven interface.


---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

To understand and apply method overloading in Java.

To perform arithmetic operations using different data types and parameters.

To implement a simple menu-based program using Java control structures.

To gain hands-on experience with user input and output in Java.

## ðŸ§  Concepts Used

Method Overloading

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Control Structures (if-else, do-while)

User Input Handling using Scanner

## âš™ Features

Add integers, doubles, or three integers.

Subtract two integers.

Multiply two double values.

Divide two integers (with basic zero check).

User-friendly menu for easy operation selection.
